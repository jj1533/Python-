---------------Fuel Cost and Electric Vehicle Charge Cost Calculator-------------------------------






The “Fuel and Electric Vehicle Cost Calculator” is an interactive Python-based application that helps users to make decisions or have ideas about transportation costs by considering destination distance, vehicle mileage, fuel prices, and electricity costs. The project includes a user-friendly graphical interface and provides a comprehensive tool for users to assess the total cost of ownership for both fuel-powered vehicles and electric vehicles(EVs).

Key Features:


*User-Friendly interface: Utilizes Tkinter for a user-friendly interface where users can input destination distance, vehicle mileage, fuel prices, and electricity costs through intuitive input fields.


*Cost Calculation:Incorporates user-provided data to perform cost calculations for both traditional vehicles and EVs.Considering factors such as fuel type, distance, fuel efficiency, fuel prices, for fuel powered 
  vehicles and electricity cost, charging efficiency, battery capacity, range for EVs.

  
*Data Visualization:Presenting data in an easily understandable format and distribution of costs based on destination distance for fuel powered vehicles and EVs.
